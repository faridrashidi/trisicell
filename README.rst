Trisicell (pronounced as "tricycle") is a computational toolkit for scalable tumor phylogeny reconstruction and validation from full-length transcriptome profiling of single-cell data (e.g. Smart-seq2) as well as single cell genome or exome sequencing data. Trisicell allows identifying and validating robust portions of a tumor phylogeny, offering the ability to focus on the most important (sub)clones and the genomic alterations that seed the associated clonal expansion. It mostly relies on [PhISCS]_, [PhISCS-BnB]_, [ScisTree]_ and [SCITE]_.
